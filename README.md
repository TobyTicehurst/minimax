== Mancala Ruleset ==

Each player has 6 pits, 1 store (to the right of their pits)

Players start with 4 stones in each pit. The first player to move is considered player 1.

1. On a player's turn, they select a pit with at least one stone in it. Pick up all stones from that pit.
2. "Sow" those stones, one at a time, starting from the pit to the right of the one selected and moving counter-clockwise. The opponent's store is skipped.
3. If the final sowed stone is placed in one of the current player's own pits which was previously empty, "capture" all stones in the opponent's opposite pit and move them to the current player's store. This can only happen when moving 13 or fewer stones since any more would result in the pit not being empty when the final stone is played.
4. If the final sowed stone is placed in the current player's store, the current player takes another turn. This can happen repeatedly.
5. If rule 4 doesn't come into effect then play passes to the opponent.
6. The game ends when a player has no stones left to move. The other player then moves all their stones into their store and whoever has the most stones in their store wins.
